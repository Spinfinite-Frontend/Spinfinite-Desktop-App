# 🖥️ Spinfinite Desktop App

This repository contains an Electron-based desktop wrapper for [Spinfinite](https://www.spinfinite.com). It lets you build and distribute a native Windows app that opens the Spinfinite site inside a custom-branded window.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Full Electron wrapper with custom icon and metadata
- Launches [https://www.spinfinite.com](https://www.spinfinite.com) inside a desktop app
- Generates a standalone Windows installer
- Easily branded (icon, title, metadata, etc)

---

## 📆 Requirements

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- NPM (comes with Node)
- macOS, Windows, or Linux
- If you're building for Windows on macOS: **Wine Crossover** installed

### Install Wine Crossover (macOS only)

```bash
brew tap gcenx/wine
brew install --cask --no-quarantine wine-crossover
```

Then link Wine64:

```bash
sudo ln -s "/Applications/Wine Crossover.app/Contents/Resources/wine/bin/wine64" /usr/local/bin/wine64
```

---

## 📁 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/spinfinite-desktop.git
cd spinfinite-desktop
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the app (dev mode)

---

## 🛠️ Building the Installer

To build a Windows `.exe` installer:

```bash

Look in the `dist/` folder:

```
dist/Spinfinite Setup 1.0.3.exe
```

This file can be shared or uploaded as the official installer.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Do **not** commit `node_modules/` or `dist/` — they are excluded in `.gitignore`
- App icon can be replaced by editing `icon.ico`
- All metadata (name, version, publisher, etc) can be modified in `package.json` under `build`
- To distribute your installer, use GitHub Releases instead of pushing binaries to the repo
